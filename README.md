# rubocop-todo-corrector

[Custom action](https://docs.github.com/en//actions/creating-actions/about-custom-actions) to create a pull request that autocorrects offenses in .rubocop_todo.yml per cop.

## Usage

### Manual running

Add the following workflow file to manually run the action:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/rubocop-todo-corrector.yml
name: rubocop-todo-corrector

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      cop_name:
        description: Pass cop name if you want to pick a specific cop.
        required: false
        type: string
      ignore:
        description: Check this with cop_name if you want to ignore a specific cop.
        required: false
        type: boolean
jobs:
  run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: r7kamura/rubocop-todo-corrector@v0
        with:
          ignore: ${{ inputs.ignore }}
```

Now you can run it via actions page:

or if you want to do it from CLI, use [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) like this:

```
gh workflow run rubocop-todo-corrector
```

After the action is complete, a pull request is created as follows:

### Automatic running

By adding `on.pull_request` to the workflow, you can automatically run it when all other labeled pull requests are merged or closed.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/rubocop-todo-corrector.yml
on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - closed
  workflow_dispatch:
    # ...
```

Note that the `label` input is required to use this feature.
Don't forget to create the label on your repository before you run the action.

### Ignore

If you pass `ignore` as `"true"`, the action will create a pull request that ignores the specified cop by appending specified `cop_name` to `.rubocop_todo_corrector_ignore`.

## Inputs

    - Required if `ignore` is `"true"`

    - Not required, but if you want to run another workflows from new pull request, you need to pass this token with `workflow` scope.

### `ignore`

- optional
- e.g. `"true"`

### `label`

- Pull request label name.
- optional
- e.g. `"rubocop-todo-corrector"`
